#summary build system proposal

= Introduction =

One of the painful first steps of any shared project is agreeing on the build system.

I'm going to propose using ant for the build, and maven ant tasks for dependency management. I've used pure Maven, pure Ant, and Ant+Ivy in the past, but Ant+Maven has worked the best for me.

= Details =

  * Use Maven layout for files
    * top-level build.xml
    * top-level pom.xml (dependencies only)
    * src/main/java
    * src/main/resources
    * src/test/java
    * src/test/resources
    * src/build/ant/build.properties (could go at top level too)
  * Either bootstrap, or have single lib/maven-ant-tasks-{{{<version>}}}.jar
  * For now, manually publish a single jar as the resulting artifact
    * could eventually push to a real Maven repo, but that gets painful

I think the Nutch, Droids and Heritrix project reps should weigh in here with their thoughts.
