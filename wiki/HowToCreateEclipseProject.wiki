#summary How to work around ant-eclipse jar not being in Maven central repo.

= Introduction =

In order to use "ant eclipse" to create an Eclipse project file, the ant-eclipse-jvm1.2-1.0.jar has to be available.

But this isn't in Maven central, so it has to manually be added to your local Maven repo.

= Details =

To install, do the following.

{{{
 % cd crawler-commons/lib
 % mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=ant-eclipse -DartifactId=ant-eclipse-jvm1.2 -Dversion=1.0 -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=ant-eclipse-jvm1.2-1.0.jar
}}}
